<strong>Markov chain Monte Carlo</strong>

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the state of art method to sample from a target distribution. One of the most widely used MCMC algorithm is Metropolis-Hastings (MH), which samples from a proposal distribution, and accepts/rejects the newly proposed sample according to the density ratio of the target at the new and current parameter values.The efficiency of the MH algorithm mainly depends on the choice of the proposal distribution.
